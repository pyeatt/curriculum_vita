Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (9/97--present) Implemented all
known POMDP exact solution algorithms. Improved some algorithms to reduce so­
lution time and allow solution of larger problems than were previously possible. Ex­
tended algorithms and code to allow parallel execution on several Unix machines.
Robotics (9/97--present) Developed a three­level control architecture for the Khep­
era robot using a symbolic planner at the highest level, POMDP planning at the middle
level, reinforcement learning at the low level. Implemented middle and low levels and
showed that a robot could learn low level extended actions as necessary to complete
its task and could modify its low level actions to adapt to sensor and effector failures.
Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning (9/96--9/97) Experimented with re­
inforcement learning using neural networks for function approximation. Ran experi­
ments using a Pente simulator, pole­balancing simulator and the Robot Auto Rac­
ing Simulator (RARS). Added a high­level controller to the RARS system to allow
switching between learned behaviors. Invented a new function approximation tech­
nique based on decision trees. Showed that it was superior to the neural network
approach.
Structure in Discrete Event Sequences (9/95--9/97) Developed method to detect
dependencies in program execution traces and construct a Semi­Markov model of the
underlying system behavior. Worked with Adele Howe, Eric Dahlman and Gabriel
Somlo to write CLASPWeb which allows anyone with a web browser to use the code.
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) (5/95--8/95) Developed method to nor­
malize lighting and remove shadows from aerial and satellite terrain photographs. The
software worked by texture mapping the photograph onto the corresponding USGS el­
evation data, calculating the position of the sun at the time the photograph was taken,
and applying an inverse lighting calculation. The normalized photograph could then
be texture mapped onto the USGS elevation data and a forward lighting model could
be applied to show lighting conditions at any time of day or year.
Genetic Algorithms (9/93--5/95) Developed system to track the ranking of hyper­
planes during genetic search; compared dynamic ranking with static ranking. Wrote
code to evolve neural network weights. Compared the results with Frederic Gruau's
Cellular Encoding method.
Senior Information Systems Programmer Texaco Inc., Houston, Texas, 9/91--9/93.
Evaluation and application of Artificial Intelligence and advanced problem solving tech­
niques for Texaco business needs. Delivered applications on PC, Unix, and IBM main­
frame platforms. Performed system administration for Unix environment. Used a wide
variety of systems, languages, tools and techniques. Two major projects were:
SpectraMan (9/92--9/94) Ultraviolet Fluorescence Spectra Manager. The software
was used to automate the process of identifying and characterizing unknown hydro­
carbon mixtures. It kept a database of thousands of known 3D ultraviolet fluorescence
spectra. The chemist could use a neural network, embedded in the software, to match

an unknown sample to every other sample in the database. The neural net selected a
user­specified number of similar spectra that the chemist could then view and print,
along with additional information in the database, in order to make a final determina­
tion about the characteristics of the unknown sample. This software greatly reduced
the time required to perform an analysis and enabled a large increase in the productiv­
ity of the chemists. I wrote the prototype in assembly and C on a PC running DOS.
The prototype showed what was possible, but was deemed too slow and could only
allow viewing of one spectrum at a time. The final version of the software was written
in C using the X Window System, Motif, OpenGL, and an SQL database server. It was
developed on Sun and delivered on SGI. The lead chemist, Dr. Marilyn Reyes, and I
were awarded United States Patent 5424959 for this software.
Reservoir Modeling Expert System (11/9--11/92) The reservoir management team
at Texaco gathers production data on every reservoir that Texaco owns. Once they
have sufficient data on a particular reservoir, they try to fit the data to one of several
mathematical models. If they select the correct model, they can accurately predict
the production of the reservoir and select an appropriate production schedule. There
were very few people experienced in selecting the model, and several experts had
recently retired or were preparing to retire. The team leader was faced with having an
inexperienced staff and no one to train them. We built an expert system for selecting
the reservoir model, allowing the team to continue its work with a reduced and less
experienced staff.
Graduate Research Assistant Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, 8/88--9/91. Re­
search in neural networks and speech recognition.
Speech Recognition Developed speaker independent speech recognition system for
digits. The speech recognition system followed the now standard model of signal pre­
processing, fast Fourier transform, Mel scale extraction, segmentation using a hidden
Markov model, and recognition. The recognition section used a neural ring pattern
classifier.
Embedded Control Evaluated currently available hardware and operating systems
for embedded distributed control of silicon wafer processing machinery. Made rec­
ommendation to the company that funded the study. Taught Introduction to Computer
Science course using Pascal. Taught digital electronics lab. Supervised construction
of circuits by the students. Assisted students in the implementation of their circuit
designs.
Self­Employed 8/88--7/89. Developed accounting and subscriber list software for small
newspapers. Wrote code in C and Pascal on IBM PC and Apple Macintosh systems.
Embedded Control Systems Design Engineer Applied Hydraulics, Lubbock, Texas,
1/87--7/88. Designed microprocessor and sequential logic based systems for industrial
control and data acquisition. Designed circuit boards for the systems. Supervised tech­
nical staff who were responsible for constructing the hardware designs. Designed and
wrote software for the new systems in assembly and C. Was responsible for all stages of
the process: assessing customer needs, creating design specifications, implementing the
systems, installing at the customer's site, and providing post­delivery technical assistance.
