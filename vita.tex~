%  in the context of robotics for my dissertation. 
% The following sections detail some of the research that 
%  I conducted at Colorado State.}
%      \begin{description}
%      \item[Partially Observable Markov Decision
%        Processes](9/97--9/99)
%        \ Implemented several POMDP solution
%        algorithms. 
%        Extended  the Incremental Pruning algorithm and code to perform
%        distributed execution on several UNIX machines.
%      \item[Robotics] (9/97--9/99)
%        \ Developed a three-level control architecture for the Khepera robot
%        using a symbolic planner at the highest level, POMDP planning at
%        the middle level, and reinforcement learning
%        at the low level.  Implemented middle and low levels and
%        demonstrated that a robot could learn low level
%        extended actions
%        as necessary to complete its task and could modify its low level
%        actions to adapt to sensor  and effector failures.
%      \item[Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning](9/96--9/97)
%        \ Experimented with reinforcement
%        learning using neural networks for function
%        approximation.  Ran experiments using a Pente simulator, pole-balancing
%        simulator, and the Robot Auto Racing Simulator (RARS).  Added a 
%        high-level controller to the RARS system to allow switching between
%        learned behaviors.  Invented a new function approximation
%        technique based on decision trees.  Showed that it was superior to
%        the neural network approach.
%      \item[Structure in Discrete Event Sequences](9/95--9/97)
%        \ Developed method to detect dependencies in program execution traces
%        and construct a Semi-Markov model of the underlying system behavior.
%        Worked with Adele Howe, Eric Dahlman
%        and Gabriel Somlo to write CLASPWeb which allows anyone with a web
%        browser to use the code. %(http://satchmo.cs.colostate.edu:4936)
%      \item[Geographical Information Systems (GIS)](5/95--8/95)
%        \ Developed method to normalize lighting and remove shadows 
%        from aerial and satellite terrain photographs.  The software
%        worked by texture mapping the photograph onto the corresponding
%        USGS elevation data, calculating the position of the sun at the
%        time the photograph was taken, and applying an inverse lighting
%        calculation.  The normalized photograph could then be texture mapped
%        onto the USGS elevation data and a forward lighting model could
%        be applied to show lighting conditions at any time of day or year.
%      \item[Genetic Algorithms](9/93--5/95)
%        \ Developed system to 
%        track the ranking of hyperplanes during genetic search;
%        compared dynamic ranking with static ranking.
%        Wrote code to evolve neural network weights. Compared the
%        results with Fr\'ed\'eric Gruau's Cellular Encoding method.  
%%      \item[Other projects]
%%        Completed several smaller projects, including a ray tracer,
%%        a computer vision system, and an optimizing compiler for a language
%%        similar to C.

\section{}
    {Senior Information Systems Programmer} {Texaco Inc., Houston 
      9/91--9/93.  Applied  Artificial
    Intelligence techniques to Texaco business needs.}
%  Delivered applications on PC, Unix, and IBM
%    mainframe platforms.  Performed system administration for Unix
%    environment.  Used a wide variety of systems, languages, tools,
%    and techniques.}
% Major projects included:}
%\begin{description}
%   \item[SpectraMan](9/92--9/94) \ Ultraviolet Fluorescence Spectra
%   Manager. The software was used to automate the process of
%   identifying and characterizing unknown hydrocarbon mixtures.  It
%   kept a database of thousands of known 3D ultraviolet fluorescence
%   spectra.  The chemist could use a neural network, embedded in the
%   software, to match an unknown sample to every other
%   sample in the database.  The neural net selected a user-specified
%   number of similar spectra that the chemist could then view and
%   print, along with additional information in the database, in
%   order to make a final determination about the characteristics of
%   the unknown sample.  This software greatly reduced the time
%   required to perform an analysis and enabled a large increase in
%   the productivity of the chemists.  I wrote the prototype in
%   assembly and C on a PC running DOS.  The prototype showed what
%   was possible, but was deemed too slow and could only allow
%   viewing of one spectrum at a time.  The final version of the
%   software was written in C using the X Window System, Motif,
%   OpenGL, and an SQL database server.  It was developed on Sun and
%   delivered on SGI.  The lead chemist, Dr. Marilyn Reyes, and I
%   were awarded United States Patent 5424959 for this software.

%   \item[Reservoir Modeling Expert System](11/9--11/92) \ The reservoir management
%   team at Texaco gathers production data on every reservoir that
%   Texaco owns.  Once they have sufficient data on a particular
%   reservoir, they try to fit the data to one of several
%   mathematical models.  If they select the correct model, they can
%   accurately predict the production of the reservoir and select an
%   appropriate production schedule.  There were very few people
%   experienced in selecting the model, and several experts had recently
%   retired or were preparing to retire. The team leader was
%   faced with having an inexperienced staff and no one to
%   train them.  We built an expert system
%   for selecting the reservoir model, allowing the team to continue
%   its work with a reduced and less experienced staff.
%\end{description}
    
 \section{}
  {Graduate Research Assistant}
   {Texas Tech University, Lubbock,  8/88--9/91. Research
  in neural networks and speech recognition.}
%\begin{description}
%      \item[Speech Recognition] Developed speaker independent speech
%      recognition system for digits.  The speech recognition system
%      followed the now standard model of signal preprocessing, fast
%      Fourier transform, Mel scale extraction, segmentation using a
%      hidden Markov model, and recognition.  The recognition section
%      used a neural ring pattern classifier.  
%      \item[Embedded Control] Evaluated hardware and
%      operating systems for embedded distributed control of silicon
%      wafer processing machinery.  Made recommendation to the
%      company that funded the study.  Taught Introduction to
%      Computer Science course using Pascal.  Taught digital
%      electronics lab.  Supervised construction of circuits by the
%      students.  Assisted students in the implementation of their
%      circuit designs.  \end{description}

%\section{}{Self-Employed}{8/88--7/89. 
%      Developed accounting and subscriber list software for small newspapers. 
%      Wrote code in C and Pascal on IBM PC and Apple Macintosh systems.}
   
\section{}{Embedded Control Systems Engineer} {Applied
  Hydraulics, Lubbock, Texas, 1/87--7/88.  Designed and built
  microprocessor and sequential logic based systems for industrial control
  and data acquisition. }
% Designed circuit boards for the systems.
%    Supervised technical staff who were responsible for constructing
%    the hardware designs.  Designed and wrote software for the new
%    systems in assembly and C.  Supervised for all stages of
%    the process: assessing customer needs, creating design
%    specifications, implementing the systems, installing at the
%    customer's site, and providing post-delivery technical
%    assistance.}
